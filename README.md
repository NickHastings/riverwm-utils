## Usage

# cycle-focused-tags

Change to either the next or previous focused tags.

Note that this functionality could easily be [built into
river](https://github.com/riverwm/river/pull/506), but because of the
plan to separate the window management to a separate client, such new
addictions are not being accepted.

The script takes two arguments: the first is being the direction
next|previous, the second being the maximum number of tags at which
the cycling should wrap back to the first tag (or to the last tag from
the first tag).

If the second argument is omitted the maximum number of tags is
assumed to be 32.  If both arguments are ommited the direction,
next, will be used.

The script can be called using spawn in the users init file. For example:
```
riverctl map normal Mod4 Up spawn "cycle-focused-tags previous 9"
riverctl map normal Mod4 Down spawn "cycle-focused-tags next 9"
```
